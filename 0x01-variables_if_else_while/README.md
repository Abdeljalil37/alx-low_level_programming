# C Programming

Welcome to the README file for C programming! This document aims to provide an overview of the awesomeness of C programming, key figures in its development, essential concepts, and useful techniques for coding in C.

## Why C Programming is Awesome

C programming is considered awesome for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency**: C is a low-level programming language that allows for close interaction with the hardware, making it highly efficient and suitable for systems programming and embedded systems.
2. **Portability**: C programs can run on different hardware platforms with minimal or no modifications, thanks to its standardized syntax and libraries.
3. **Speed**: C programs execute quickly, making it ideal for applications that require high performance and real-time processing.
4. **Wide Application**: C has been used in various fields, including operating systems, device drivers, game development, and scientific applications, making it a versatile language.
5. **Structured Programming**: C supports structured programming principles, allowing for modular and organized code development.
6. **Extensibility**: C is the foundation for many other programming languages, including C++, Objective-C, and C#, making it a valuable skill for programmers.

## Inventor of C

C programming language was invented by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. Ritchie's creation of C was motivated by the need for a programming language to develop the Unix operating system.

## Key Figures in C Programming

1. **Dennis Ritchie**: Inventor of the C programming language and one of the key contributors to the development of the Unix operating system.
2. **Brian Kernighan**: Collaborated with Dennis Ritchie in the creation of C and co-authored the book "The C Programming Language," commonly referred to as K&R C.
3. **Linus Torvalds**: Creator of the Linux operating system, which heavily relies on the C programming language.

## Compiling C Code

To compile a C program, you can use the `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) command-line utility. When you type `gcc main.c`, the compiler reads the `main.c` file and produces an executable file.

## Entry Point and Main Function

In C, an entry point is the starting point of a program's execution. The entry point for a C program is the `main` function. The program execution begins from the first line of code in the `main` function and proceeds sequentially.

## Printing Text in C

In C, there are several ways to print text:

1. **printf**: The `printf` function allows you to format and print text to the standard output. It offers various formatting options, such as specifying variables, strings, and numeric values.
2. **puts**: The `puts` function is used to print a string to the standard output followed by a newline character.
3. **putchar**: The `putchar` function is used to print a single character to the standard output.

## Getting the Size of a Specific Type

To get the size of a specific type in C, you can use the unary operator `sizeof`. For example, `sizeof(int)` returns the size in bytes of the `int` type.

## Compiling C Code with gcc

To compile C code using `gcc`, you can use the following command:

```
gcc <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

This command compiles the C source code in `<source_file.c>` and generates an executable file named `<output_file>`.

## Default Program Name in gcc Compilation

When compiling with `gcc`, the default program name is usually `a.out` unless you specify a different output filename using the `-o` option.
