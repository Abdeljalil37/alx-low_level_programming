# C Programming Basics

This repository provides a collection of C programming basics, focusing on the usage of `man` and `help` for various commands and functions. It covers essential concepts and commands, including `gcc`, `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of the following topics:

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the reasons why C programming is considered awesome.
- Learn about the key figures behind the invention of C, including Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
- Explore what happens when you type `gcc main.c` and gain insight into the compilation process.
- Comprehend the concept of an entry point and the role of the `main` function in a C program.
- Master various methods of printing text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- Learn how to determine the size of a specific type using the `sizeof` unary operator.
- Understand how to compile C programs using `gcc` and explore the default program name during compilation.
- Familiarize yourself with the official C coding style and how to check your code using `betty-style`.
- Gain proficiency in finding the appropriate header files to include in your source code when using standard library functions.
- Explore how the `main` function influences the return value of a C program.
